# Current Development
Currently, the bot follows an eval system that plays based on material values. So in particular, it prioritizes checks over everything in this part of the game. Further development includes connecting the bot to the SushiMan_Bot account on lichess.org and playing games there.

# SushiMan's Chess Engine
A chess engine created in python by Sushim Malla that uses the minimax algorithm to find the best move according to evaluations.py and play it against a given bot. You could plug it into any chess GUI application and play it. You can play the bot by adding SushiMan_Bot on lichess.org.

# Installation
To use this bot, download the repository and install the nessacary requirements by opening cmd and typing in `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

# Plans for the future
The plans for the future for this bot is to host it on lichess where you can play the bot at any given moment.
