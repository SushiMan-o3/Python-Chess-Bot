# Current Development
Currently fixing minimax. 

# SushiMan's Chess Engine
A chess engine created in python by Sushim Malla that uses the minimax algorithm to find the best move according to evaluations.py and play it against a given bot. You could plug it into any chess GUI application and play it. You can play the bot by adding SushiMan_Bot on lichess.org. To make the bot work faster, alpha beta pruning is added in order to skip moves that are guarenteed to be worse than the current best move. 

# Installation
To use this bot, download the repository and install the nessacary requirements by opening cmd and typing in `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

# Plans for the future
Bot is being tested
